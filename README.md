# Exodus: To The Heavens !
Heyya !
You ever wanted an experience similar to SevTech Ages, but with more emphasis on gritty pre-industrial survival ?

Introducing: Exodus.



Exodus gives you a rather authentic back-to-the-land experience, complete with grueling Neolithic-esque tech, rough survival tweaks
and a tinge of fantasy.

- Raw meat will make you a schizophrenic vampire while avoiding bread is death by hunger;

- Undead are mostly immortal, and mobs will smell you;

- You can be a witch, or make beer, or be a beer-making witch;

- Blood moons are ironically safe, if you don't mind the harmless screaming eyes;

- The seasons control your agricultural endeavors, while most food rots within two days and stronger mobs show up in temperature extremes;

- Speaking of temperature extremes, the world is mostly dominated by hot biomes (which is good if you're into growing tons of wheat);

- Put the furnace aside, use PrimalCore's Sariras bloomery to smelt ores while the Witch's Oven actually stacks cooked foods;

- Can't mine stone without bone or smooth stone, or wood without flint;

- Speaking of tools, most vanilla tools are disabled, and metal tools can only be made with Tinker's in mind;

- The weather isn't too bad, just don't fall into shark-infested waters;

And much more !
